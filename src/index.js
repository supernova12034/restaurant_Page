//We're here, solved an earlier problem with webpack,
//solved another problem with CORS error(by opening a
//local web server) but now for some reason, 
//when I try to use the imported module,
//it throws a weird error?

// import {pageLoad} from './pageIntro';

// pageLoad();

console.log("testing restaurant page");
